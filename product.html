            Corefuse is a revolutionary application meant to make the most out of your cpu<br />
            Corefuse has a simple goal: "Leave No Core Behind"; Corefuse allows the cpu to<br />
            multithread even if a program is not capable of doing it, which can provide <br />
            huge boosts in performance in applications that are heavy on single-core usage.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Virtual Proxy Core:</strong> The key feature that makes Corefuse work is the virtual proxy core.<br />
                Corefuse is capable of simulating a single core to act as a proxy for applications reliant on<br />
                heavy single-core usage.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong> Application Analysis:</strong> An optional feature that allows users to see just how much - or little - <br />
                CPU power an application uses. Helpful for fine-tuning how Corefuse works with certain apps.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Extensive Customization:</strong> Corefuse works automatically, but allows users to fully customize how<br />
                they want it to work to best suit their needs. Additionally, it can even be turned off and<br />
                just let the computer run the application as is if issues occur.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Application Presets:</strong> Customizations can be saved on an app by app basis, to ensure every<br />
                experience can be tailored properly and without fear of breaking other programs.
            </li>
        </ul>
