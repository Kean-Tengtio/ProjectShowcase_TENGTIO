    <h1>Benefits</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Increased Performance</h2>
        <p>
            This is especially true for CPUs with large amounts of individually weaker cores.<br />
            There are applications that are unable to make much use of these CPUs, especially<br />
            older ones that did not have these at the time.
        </p>

        <h2>Unintrusive Process</h2>
        <p>
            Rather than fiddling with internal processes, it simply acts as a median, keeping<br />
            important processes intact. This also means it is highly compatible.
        </p>

        <h2>Lightweight</h2>
        <p>
            The program itself does not take a significant footprint in processing power, <br />
            so that it does not detract from its performance boost.
