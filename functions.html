    <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Proxy Core</h2>
        <p>
            Corefuse creates a virtual core that will act as the main core for the application.<br />
            This core will pool power equally from every core on the actual CPU for it to function. <br />
            Of note is that it simply reserves a portion from each one, rather than constantly taking power.
        </p>
        <h2>Activation & Deactivation</h2>
        <p>
            Corefuse only activates when allowed, and, by default, will not activate on any application.<br />
            The user will be told this beforehand. The application will bring up a list on first start-up<br />
            of applications it considers valid, though the user can manually add them on their own.<br />
            Once the program it is running for closes, it will either return to idle or close entirely,<br />
            depending on its settings.
